// The DoubleBuffer is reponsible for ensuring a thread safe double buffering
// mechanism that receives samples from GStreamer, prepares an extraction of
// these samples and presents the most recent extraction to an external
// mechanism (e.g. UI).
// The DoubleBuffer hosts two SampleExtractors and an AudioBuffer:
//   - The SampleExtractor trait is designed to allow the extraction of samples
//   depending on certains conditions as defined in its concrete implementation.
//   - The AudioBuffer manages the container for all the samples received.
// The DoubleBuffer prepares the extraction in the working_buffer and exposes
// the exposed_buffer during that time. When the extration is done, the buffers
// are swapped.
