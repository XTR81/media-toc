# Media-TOC
Media-TOC is an application to build a table of contents from of a media file or
to split a media file into chapters.

**Important**: Media-TOC is in an early stage of development. Don't expect
anything usable soon. Of course, you can [contribute](#contribute) to the project
if you find it interesting.

# Design
## Technologies
Media-TOC is developped in Rust. This is my first project using this language.
This branch relies on the following technologies:
- **GTK-3** ([official documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/),
[Rust binding](https://crates.io/crates/gtk)) and [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/).
- **Cairo** ([official documentation](https://www.cairographics.org/documentation/),
[Rust binding](https://crates.io/crates/cairo-rs)).
- **GStreamer** ([official documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/),
[Rust binding](https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs)).

## Status
At the moment, Media-TOC can:
- Open a media file (audio, video - and image but that doesn't make much sense).
- Display the first video frame
- Display the cover image if available.
- Display metadata from the media.
- Display the first buffers' wave form.
- Display chapters' data (ffmpeg version only ATM).

# Environment preparation
## Toolchain
You can install Rust via your package manager or using Rustup which allows
installing the compiler for your user only and which will fetch the latest
nightly versions. The nightly version is required for
[this feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.get_or_insert)).

### Using the distribution's package manager
Example on Fedora:
```
$ sudo dnf install rust cargo
```

### Using rustup
```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
See the full documentation [here](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#installation).

## Dependencies
Dependencies are handled by [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/). You will need the
following packages installed on your OS:

### Fedora
```
$ sudo dnf install gtk3-devel glib2-devel gstreamer1-devel
```

### Debian & Unbuntu
**Needs confirmation**
```
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev
```

### OS X
**Needs confirmation**
```
$ brew install gtk+3 gstreamer-1.0-devel
```

# Build and run
Use Cargo (from the root of the project directory):
```
$ cargo run
```
